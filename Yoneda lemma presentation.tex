\begin{definition}[Representation of a functor]
\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A representation of a covariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object $c \in C$ 
along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(c,-) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] 
Dually, A representation of a contravariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object 
$c \in C$ along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(-,c) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A funtor is representable if it has a representation.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
For issues with size, we need $C$ to be locally small.

\begin{block}{Any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group}
\smallskip
Consider a group $G$ as a category $BG$ with a single object $*$, and morphisms $g \in G$ with 
multiplication as composition. Using the Yoneda embedding each $g \in G$ 
induces an automorphism of $Hom(*,*) = G$. But functoriality and faithfulness implies 
that $g \mapsto g*$ is a group monomorphism. So $G$ is a subgroup of the
permutation group of $Hom(*,*)$.

\only<1>{
$\widehat{C}$ has small limits and co-limits. For a small diagram $F : I \to \widehat{C}$ 
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ (\lim_{\to} F(i))(U) = (\lim_{\to}F(i)(U)) \]
}
Specifically $\widehat{C}$ has products and co-products indexed over a set.
And hence also pullbacks, pushouts and equalizers.
}

\only<2>{
$\widehat{C}$ has exponentials when $C$ is small. For $A, B : C^{op} \to Set$ we have
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ B^A(I) \cong Nat(Y(I), B^A) \cong Nat(Y(I) \times A, B) \]
}
The first isomorphism follows directly from the Yoneda lemma.
The second isomorphism follows if we assume that exponentials exists. 
Since it is well formed, this actually gives a definition of the exponential.
