\begin{definition}[Representation of a functor]
\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A representation of a covariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object $c \in C$ 
along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(c,-) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] 
Dually, A representation of a contravariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object 
$c \in C$ along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(-,c) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A funtor is representable if it has a representation.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
For issues with size, we need $C$ to be locally small.

\begin{block}{Covariant representable functors}
\begin{enumerate}

$Hom(\mathbf{1}, X) \cong X$.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The forgetful functor $U : Group \to Set$ is represented by
$\mathbb{Z}$.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] The forgetful functor $U : Top \to Set$ is represented by the

$X$ to its set of paths is represented by the unit interval $I$.

set of open subsets is represented by the Sierpienski space $S$.

For a locally small category $C$ and a covariant functor $F : C \to Set$,

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Some nice properties of $\widehat{C} = Set^{C^{op}}$}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
$\widehat{C}$ has small limits and co-limits. For a small diagram $F : I \to \widehat{C}$ 
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ (\lim_{\to} F(i))(U) = (\lim_{\to}F(i)(U)) \]
}
Specifically $\widehat{C}$ has products and co-products indexed over a set.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
$\widehat{C}$ has exponentials when $C$ is small. For $A, B : C^{op} \to Set$ we have
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ B^A(I) \cong Nat(Y(I), B^A) \cong Nat(Y(I) \times A, B) \]
}
The first isomorphism follows directly from the Yoneda lemma.
The second isomorphism follows if we assume that exponentials exists. 
Since it is well formed, this actually gives a definition of the exponential.

\end{enumerate}
