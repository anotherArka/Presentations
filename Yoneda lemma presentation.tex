\begin{definition}[Representation of a functor]
\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A representation of a covariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object $c \in C$ 
along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(c,-) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$] 
Dually, A representation of a contravariant functor $F : C \to Set$ consists of an object 
$c \in C$ along with a natural isomorphism $\alpha : Hom(-,c) \cong F$.\smallskip

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
A funtor is representable if it has a representation.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
For issues with size, we need $C$ to be locally small.

\begin{frame}
\begin{proof}[Proof of faithfulness]
For $f, g : c \to d$, $f_* = g_*$ implies 
 \[f = (f_*)_c(id_c) = (g_*)_c(id_c) = g \]  

\end{proof}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\begin{proof}[Proof of fullness]
Using the Yoneda lemma with $F = Hom(-,d)$ we get
\[ \Phi^{Hom(-,d)}_c : Hom(c,d) \cong Nat(Hom(-,c), Hom(-,d)). \]

\section{Consequences}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Uniqueness of representations}

If $Hom(c,-) \cong F \cong Hom(d,-)$ then using Yoneda lemma there is an unique
isomorphism $f : c \to d$ giving this particular natural isomorphism.

\frametitle{An alternate proof of Cayley's theorem}
\begin{block}{Any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation group}
\smallskip
Consider a group $G$ as a category $BG$ with a single object $*$, and morphisms $g \in G$ with 
multiplication as composition. Using the Yoneda embedding each $g \in G$ 
induces an automorphism of $Hom(*,*) = G$. But functoriality and faithfulness implies 
that $g \mapsto g*$ is a group monomorphism. So $G$ is a subgroup of the
permutation group of $Hom(*,*)$.

\frametitle{Some nice properties of $\widehat{C} = Set^{C^{op}}$}

\begin{enumerate}

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
$\widehat{C}$ has small limits and co-limits. For a small diagram $F : I \to \widehat{C}$ 
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ (\lim_{\to} F(i))(U) = (\lim_{\to}F(i)(U)) \]
}
Specifically $\widehat{C}$ has products and co-products indexed over a set.

\item[$\blacktriangleright$]
$\widehat{C}$ has exponentials when $C$ is small. For $A, B : C^{op} \to Set$ we have
\textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{
\[ B^A(I) \cong Nat(Y(I), B^A) \cong Nat(Y(I) \times A, B) \]
}
The first isomorphism follows directly from the Yoneda lemma.
The second isomorphism follows if we assume that exponentials exists. 
Since it is well formed, this actually gives a definition of the exponential.
