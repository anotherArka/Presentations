A proposition can be considered as a type \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$A$} with 
the witnesses/proofs as its terms.
\pause
So to prove \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$A$} we need to show that 
there is a term \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$a : A$}.

Classical axioms such as

We will extend type theory such that:

\item Types can depend on terms.
\item Types can be terms themselves.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\label{frame : universes}

To consider types are terms we need types of types. These special types
whose terms are types are called \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{universes}.

the terms of this type are points in \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$S^2$}.

\item We associate to \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$p \in S^2$}
the type whose terms are tangent vectors at \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$p$}.
Then this is like a type family.      
\pause
\item \textcolor{beamer@mathtext}{$\prod$}-type corresponds to vector fields (sections).
